Did our laundry early in the morning and then went to bed at 1pm, then  woke up at around 9 pm, finally started at 9:45.

What we will be doing today.
- [ ] Experiment with the normal transfer shader, is it possible to replicate in unreal??
Note: It should be, using unreal particles, but that might get heavy.

- [ ] Gamelift Plugin
- [ ] Get gamelift live
- [ ] Get Gamelift anywhere started atleast.

We will be making the Gamelift plugin for our basic multiplayer game. and then we will integrate Gamelift with UE5 project.
The project that i have, need to be opened in development editor mode if we want to open the unreal editor from VS.
And use only Ctrl+B after selecting the template solution not shift or else the whole engine will compile.

Now, I think that Harsh will get the multiplayer plugin sorted and I will be able to merge the two stuff together fairly easily ig.
