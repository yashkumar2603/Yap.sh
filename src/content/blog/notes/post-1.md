# Yapping

I am writing this post about a project that I am about to code alongside a video made by Harkirat Singh, oon youtube.


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zi0iR3UN-u0?si=JP-BLbApetGLeRG2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This video, and I will use Cloudflare R2 instead of the AWS S3 used here. Should be trivial to swap these two. 

Along with these, several other stuff on the blockchain, 2 backend workers. My own private key ffor the main account and stuff, then deploy this.

I hope to make this more centric towards getting ur resume seen and approved by other people. Let's see. It is actually a good idea ig.

Seeing the video as of today on 25th, have inter IIT submission tomorrow, have to work on CV and then the AWS game dev project, I will have to complete this project within 2nd of January, or i would say well within 30th of December.

# Dev-log -

Now I shall write the Dev-log once the yapping is done.

# 25th Dec

I am seeing the video, doing some interIIT work on the side and worried about less amount of time in my hand for doing shit.
