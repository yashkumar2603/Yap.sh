It was in the early morning hours of 26th October that i raised to him my concerns regarding my hairfall, and told that it is due to stress and all, panic on insignificant things. It was at the MMM mess (new part).
The topic quickly changed into my career after we talked about the topic of what do i stress about actually. He suggested that I should focus more on being in one of the cutting edged tech exploring people in startups. Rather than being in the ones that stay a bit behind by working in a super niche thing in a big company like FAANG.
The convo quickly changed into his career and his wish to get into streaming and leave behind the grind for the interns and just do what is his dream since 5 years, the dream that he has been puttinng on hold for several times now and that has kkinda taken a toll on his creativity as well. The dreams are big and need determination.
So he decided not to do DSA for now, just do it during placements and secure a decent job if things turn for the worst.
But they probably wont.
> If u know thatt u are better than most in some field then it is your moral duty to do that and uplift humanity. One must always havee in his mind the thought of serving others using his best skills.

This is what I took away from a part of the convo, upon him `mentioning how he sees the directors vision while watching videos/ creation, he notices what they want to convey.
