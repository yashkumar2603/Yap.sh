Gave the Interview for the Inter IIT Tech 13.0 ISRO Data Analysis + Astronomy PS.
> I was prepared quite a lot with a nice CV i would say. I'd say i did everything well more or less except for the moment they asked me if i had seen the the data-set, I said I haven't, becaouse I really hadn't. The PS was well prepared.

I told him that I have this idea of UV unwrapping the sphere model of the moon and then projecting the data and re-wrapping on the sphere for visualization.
He seemed to be intrigued. But the thing is that I was speaking really jerky cuz my heartbeeat must have been like 120. Tho I would say that i rawdogged the interview quite a lot, like really rawdogged the shot outta this. But its fine ig now problems.

Another thing that happened was that he asked me which part of the project I would be very healpful in useful in, I was not able to answer sharply. I said some broken bits.
Also i was sayin "like this", "like that..." a lot. This was bad if u ask me, kinda was not like how it should have been. The reason I was acing the interviews in first year but cant do that right now as far as I can think of it as of now is that I dont anymore think that i have the upper hand in the convo. I think that they are here to test me, not like I am here to prove myself. While knowing well that I am actually better than them. This is kinda the thing in interviews ig, that the interviewer must think that u are better than them, might be in some niceh stack but still u are better in something they dont know.

Overall, I dont think i will make it in, but ha I must fix my convo sharpness, just talk to Demetri ig. Like just read the stuff he is interested in and then talk to him.
