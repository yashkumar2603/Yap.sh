Starting at 5:18 am, I am starting the course for AWS game-dev challenge, super excited and racing.
Got 19 days, with the tracking whiteboard and all ready.
Will be writing the Dev-log here, Arc will be the place to watch videos, Zen browser for music and writing notes/ Dev-logs.

# Tasks -
- [ ] Go with the First section, Setup Rider.
- [ ] Look into the source control strategy to implement.
- [ ] Experiment with the normal transfer shader, is it possible to replicate in unreal??
